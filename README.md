Arduino microntroller code for a Ghostbusters Proton Pack

Work in progress code for a Arduino based proton pack with polyphonic sound effects.

Main hardware consists of a Arduino Mega micro controller in the proton pack and a Arduino Nano in the Neutrona wand.

Wiring diagrams and instructions will follow soon as the project progresses.
